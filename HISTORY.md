# Release 1.0.1
- Fixed an issue where the tooltip for base yields would still show a penalty when the player selected a tile that was already converted to an urban tile.

# Release 1.0.0
- Added an overview of a tile’s base yields, which are lost when upgrading the tile to an urban district. This is especially useful when removing an existing rural improvement, such as a farm.
