# Release 1.1.0
- Added a lens for Religion. This lens will show you on the world map which towns have been converted to which religion based on a default set of colors.
- Automatically enable the Religion lens when selecting a Missionary unit.

# Release 1.0.1
- Fixed an issue where the tooltip for base yields would still show a penalty when the player selected a tile that was already converted to an urban tile.

- Added an overview of a tileâ€™s base yields, which are lost when upgrading the tile to an urban district. This is especially useful when removing an existing rural improvement, such as a farm.
