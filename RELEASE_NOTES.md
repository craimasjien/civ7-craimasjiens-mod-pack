# Release 1.1.2
- Thanks to outstanding work and collaboration from the people in the official Discord (Shoutout @realitymeltdown and @RogueAustralian), we were able to find a non-destructive way to alter the behaviour and the UI of the mini-map panel. What this essentially means is that my Religion Lens should work with future other lenses created by Firaxis, but also other mods that add lenses. 

**I highly encourage people to take the same approach this mod takes so lenses (and potentially other UI adjustments) can work together seamlessly in the future.**
