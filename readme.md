# Craimasjien's Mod Pack for Civilization VII

This pack is my on-going attempt to fix all the things I don't like about the vanilla Civilization VII experience. 
Feel free to request features and I will attempt to implement them as best I can.

## Features
- Added an overview of the base yields of a tile that will be removed once the tile is upgraded to an urban district. ![base yields about to be removed](screenshots/BaseYields.jpg "Base Yields")

## Roadmap / Wishlist
- Work in progress

## Abouts

### About me
I'm Bryan, a 33 year old engineering manager at a SaaS company. I used to be a developer (mobile apps, web apps, REST APIs) before I started my career as a manager. I still love fiddling around with code from now and then.

### About the mod
This mod was born from my dissatisfaction with the state the game launched in. A friend of mine and myself found ourselves frustrated with seemingly little oversights by Firaxis. When I found out the stack for modding was built around HTML, CSS and JavaScript I decided that I could probably fix the things I don't like, and help the community in the process.
